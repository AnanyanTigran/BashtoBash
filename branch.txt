The orphan branch is a branch who  haven't a parent commit, We can make commits but this branch does not share any commit history with master branch   This can be useful when We want to publish the tree from a commit without exposing its full history. We can publish an open source branch of a project whose current tree is "clean.
To create an orphan branche we need to run git checkout --orphan branch-name.
It's worked like common branches,so we can add files and commit them,but we can't merge them as usual.
If we want to merge files from orphan branch to main branch  we need to run this - git merge branch-name --allow-unrelated-histories, thats it.
